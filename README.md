## Wellcome to **MyFilmList**!

Imagine that you are watching a film or a TV show with your family, your friends, or even with that special person... then something happens, you realise you've already seen it! But, of course, you can't tell anybody because you don't want to ruin the night...  

I bet this is the worst nightmare for anybody who wants to have an exciting time experiencing new sensations, and I say "I bet" because since me and my mate José use **MyFilmList** we don't have this worry anymore!

**MyFilmList** is an application where you can follow what you are watching. Everytime you look at a film or a TV show, just open the app, find it and add it to the *viewed* ones. You can also access to the film you've watched and make a review of it, just if the time passes and you forget what you thought about it!  

This app was created for the subject of *applications development* imparted in the Complutense University of Madrid.
